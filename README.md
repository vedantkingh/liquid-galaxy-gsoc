# GSoC Sample Application

This is a simple Android application I made to complete task 3.2 of the preselection requirements of Liquid Galaxy for GSoC 2023 created using Android Studio.
I have used Java and XML for this app.
It has 4 buttons and the Liquid Galaxy logo as it's icon as well as in several places inside the application.
## How to use
The usage of the app is pretty simple to figure out, on the homescreen, you will be able to see the Liquid Galaxy logo, the Google Summer of Code logo, and 4 buttons.
### The functions of those 4 buttons are: 
* **About Me Button -** This button will open an activity with a Liquid Galaxy logo and my information about me.
* **LG VM Setup Video-** This button will redirect you to a Google Drive link to the video I have submitted for my preselection task 3.1 which required me to setup a Liquid Galaxy rig on my PC and record the final result.
* **LG Website-** This button will open up the Liquid Galaxy website(https://www.liquidgalaxy.eu/) on your browser.
* **E-mail me-** This button will open up your mail application with my details pre-entered so that you can mail me.
